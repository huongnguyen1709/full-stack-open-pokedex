Setup Continuous Integration (CI) With React, CircleCI, and GitHub: - Create React App - Create GitHub Repository - Setting Up CI With CircleCI - Push the Code to Your Repository - Start building
Setting Up CircleCI With React: - Use config.yml setup to run test, lint and build checks with React. - After pushing this code, give the orb the permissions it needs. Each commit/PR now runs the workflow jobs.
Check CircleCI for the progress of the jobs. Hereâ€™s what CircleCI is doing for each commit:
Set up the React project: - Runs ESLint to check the formatting of the code. - Runit tests. - Runs test coverage.
Besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions, there are some alternatives to set up the CI: - Jenkins - TeamCity - Bamboo - Buddy - GitLab CI - CircleCI - TravisCI
This setup would be better in a cloud-based environment because : - The application being worked by a team, it is better to be hosted in a cloud-base environment that make the maintenance of a code to be easier. - Code is stored in Github, that can be accessed anywhere there is internet connectivity. - Cloud computing systems are significantly better secured than self-hosting services.
